#Dial with iPhone
##an Alfred 2 workflow by [Carl Smith (@CarlosNZ)](http://geekzone.philosophicalzombie.net/)

###v1.2 [(What's new?)](./changelog.html) | 20th March 2013

This workflow allows you use Alfred to send a phone number to your iPhone, which your phone will then dial automatically when you open the notification. You will need to have [Prowl](http://www.prowlapp.com/) installed on your iPhone to receive the notifications. You can send a number from either:

* a contact you have in your Mac Address Book
* selected text (say, a phone number on a website)
* a manually entered number.

###Usage

First things first: you need an API key for Prowl - a unique string of digits that allows Alfred to connect to the Prowl service on your behalf. Get that [here](https://www.prowlapp.com/api_settings.php), or the workflow will direct you to the site when you first use it.

The workflow should prompt you for your API key the first time you run it. If you need to change it at some point, use the keyword **dial setup**.

Enter it in, and you're good to go.

You can now manually send a phone number. Try **dial *phonenumber*** in Alfred and you should receive the Prowl alert on your iPhone within seconds. (Alfred will show you a notification confirming the success or failure of the phone number transmission.)

####With *"Selected Text"*

To send *selected text*, invoke the workflow via a *hotkey*. You'll need to configure this hotkey in the ***Workflows*** pane of Alfred's preferences:

####Send a Contact's phone number

To send the number of a contact from your Address Book, you'll need to enable a "custom action" in Alfred's ***Contact*** preferences.

For the contact field *"Phone"*, choose the action *"Dial with iPhone (via Prowl)"*. And that's it. Now, when you display a Contact in Alfred, just select their phone number to dial it from your iPhone!
